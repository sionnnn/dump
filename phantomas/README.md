#grunt-Phantomas

* Runs Phantomas performance test and produces output

------

* Creates a new folder 'phantomas' which contains index.html and various other resources. This is a visual display of the tests it has done.
* Can test on local site or live site. 
* It is fast to test.
* Great for monitoring site performance over time. I am very impressed with this - definetly recomend using it.

* Look at image for example output
