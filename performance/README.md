#grunt-csscsss

* Looks for duplicated css rules
* Need to install it in Ruby with: 'gem install csscss'

------

#grunt-parker

* CSS Stats
* Interesting to see but not very useful, I would not recomend wasting time with this.

------

#time-grunt

* See how long grunt tasks have taken to execute.
* Requires no config, just 'require('time-grunt')(grunt);'
* Very useful

#grunt-uncss

* Removes unused CSS
* Could be a problem when using dynamic content or templates
* Works very well for static files
* Generates new file
