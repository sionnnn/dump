#imagemin

delete images in tests>images>min

```shell
>npm install
>grunt
```

* generates minified versions of png,jpg,gif and svg images

------

* Not many configuration options so no way of renaming files, just put them in different folder
* Works well but reports on the web of unwanted effects occasionally so probably needs human checking afterwards
* optimizationLevel config doesnt seem to do much in regards to filesize in my examples
* Simple to use
