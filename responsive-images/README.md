#responsive-images

delete images in tests>images>responsive

* creates multiple versions of images at various sizes
* not really appropriate for cms images and sitecore handles resizing etc itself anyway
* would need additional solution to serve appropriate image for screen size
* not very flexibile as settings need to be defined beforehand so possibly good for lots of images of the same size but not so much for varying images
