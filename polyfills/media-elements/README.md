Supprt for <audio> and <video> elements
=======================================

We tend to use YouTube or Vimeo and we should really produce modules for these mainly but if not native support for the media elements mainly <video> and <audio> can be had through the following which I will take a look at

[mediaelement.js](http://mediaelementjs.com/)  
[jPlayer](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer)
[Sound Manager 2](http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/)
