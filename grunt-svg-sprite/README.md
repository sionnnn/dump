* Creates a nice svg using :target to display what you want

------

* takes svg files from the src/svg folder
* is put into public/assets/svg/stack/svg/sprite.stack.svg - need to figure out how to change this

------

* Works great for inline images on all modern browsers - may need an IE8 fallback
* Does not work for background images on chrome - this may be a massive deal breaker
